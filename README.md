# Urban-Pluvial-Flood-Risk-Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of urban pluvial (surface water) flood risk. Using a dataset of nearly 3,000 urban segments from cities worldwide, the analysis aims to identify risk factors, clean and prepare the data, engineer meaningful features, and derive insights into what makes certain areas more susceptible to flooding.
